      You are reviewing a BEGINNER Django project README.
      Scoring:
      - PASS: Has ALL THREE core elements: (1) title/heading, (2) brief description, (3) basic install/run steps.
      - PARTIAL: Has only TWO of the core elements OR all three are present but one is very weak (e.g. ultra vague description).
      - FAIL: Has zero or only one core element.
      Improvement ideas (usage examples, contribution guide, env file docs) should NOT reduce to FAIL—list them as suggestions.
      Output format:

      Beginner Django readability review.
      Scoring:
      - PASS: Naming mostly clear; structure understandable; no large duplicated blocks; only minor style issues.
      - PARTIAL: Overall understandable but 2–3 moderate issues (some vague names, some duplication, a few long functions).
      - FAIL: Multiple severe issues making code hard to follow (widespread unclear naming + big duplication OR dead code blobs).

      Beginner security audit (focus on obvious issues).
      Scoring:
      - PASS: No hardcoded SECRET_KEY or credentials. DEBUG True alone does NOT force PARTIAL/FAIL.
      - PARTIAL: No secrets exposed but some risky config (DEBUG True + wide ALLOWED_HOSTS, or missing use of env for DB).
      - FAIL: SECRET_KEY or credentials plainly hardcoded OR obvious sensitive token in code.

      Complexity review (beginner tolerance).
      Scoring:
      - PASS: Functions mostly short/medium; nesting shallow; any long function still linear/readable.
      - PARTIAL: A few (1–2) long or moderately nested functions but not pervasive; still maintainable.
      - FAIL: Several (>=3) very long AND deeply nested / tangled functions or clear spaghetti patterns.

      Git message quality (beginner).
      Scoring:
      - PASS: Majority (>=60%) of commits have descriptive messages (even without Conventional prefix).
      - PARTIAL: 40–59% descriptive OR too many generic messages but some are ok.
      - FAIL: Very sparse history (1–2 commits) OR most messages meaningless (“update”, “fix”, “stuff”).

      Evaluate distribution of business logic.
      Scoring:
      - PASS: Views mostly thin; heavy logic either absent or acceptably small.
      - PARTIAL: Some (1–2) views contain logic that could move to model/helpers, but not systemic.
      - FAIL: Many views hold large business logic blocks that clearly belong in models/services.
